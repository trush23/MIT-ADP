MIT Applied Data Science and ML Course Projects. 
This Folder contains a variety of projects done during the 12-week MIT Applied Data Science course. My choices for the Elective Project and the Capstone Project are from Deep Learning module because of my interest in medical image-based problems. The course itself has the following structure and courses: 
1) Foundations of Data Sciences
2) Dat Analysis and Visualization
3) Machine Learning (Regression, Regularisation, Bootstrapping, Model Evaluation, Classification)
4) Practical Data Science (Descision Trees, Random Forests, Time Series)
5) Elective Project
6) Deep Learning (Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks)
7) Recommender System
8) Capstone Project
9) Additional Self Study Content: Mastering Big Data Analytics, Instroduction to AI on Cloud
